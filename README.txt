COMP 559 - Winter 2021 - Assignment 1

Numerical Integration of Particle Systems


# Mouse spring interaction
This is best tested with the default test system 1.
Very useful for more realistic dragging of particles during simulation.

# Particles with mass
Particles can have different mass - set this in the option panel before creating the particle.
The size of the particle will proportional to the mass, that is they all have the same "density".

# Particles with colour
The colour of particles depends on the velocity and direction in which they are moving.

# Interesting Movie
I have saved an interesting spider-like creature with restitution and colourful particles with different mass.

# Save and load
The button are implemented in the options and uses xlsx files which has the advantage of being human editable.
